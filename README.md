Created by: Pawel Wnuk Lipinski

The objective of the analysis is to explore the results of Stack Overflow Surveys, looking specifically from the perspecitve of Data Science field. The survey is run annually since 2011. Years 2018-2022 are being analysed.

https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

The analysis is prepared in a Jupyter Notebook "Stack Overflow Survey Analysis - a Data Scientist perspective" with the use of Python programming language.

By data analysis of the survey results I look for interesting insights related to Data Science field. I am looking for an answer to the following questions:

* How do Data Scientists work (hybrid / remote / in-person)?
* What is the education level of Data Scientists and how it has changed over time?
* How Data Scientist learn to code?
* How much Data Scientists earn and how much the salaries differ between countries?
* What are the most popular technologies used?
* Do mental health problems and accessibility issues affect Data Scientists?


#### Summary
The analysis, which is based on the results from stack overflow survey in years 2018-2022, provided interesting insights related to the way Data Scientists work, their education level, ways to learn, salaries, most common technologies and touches important subjects like mental health and accessibility issues. Depending on the reader, if that is a Data Scientist, aspiring Data Scientist or someone from a company managing and building Data Science Teams, everyone should find interesting information in the results of the analysis.
